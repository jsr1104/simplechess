## Simple Chess App
# What functional features I want:
- follows chess rules (castling, en passant, checkmate)
- after clicking on a piece, it shows possible moves
- a piece that is currently preventing a check is blocked from being movable

# What UI features I want:
- Themes (changing how pieces look and the color of the board)
- Moving a piece allows it to hover
- Highlighted spaces for possible movement positions

# Future features (optional as this is a starter project):
- AI bot or some algorithmic bot opponent
- Playing online over a browser
